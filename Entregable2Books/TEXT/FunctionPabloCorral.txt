saying: "introduzca usuario" will be displayed. There is also one pull down menu called autores that shows the autors of the app.
 Once everything is correctly filled, the information is sent into the database, where it is saved. If the user introduced in the field Usuario is not one of the users
in the database, a new html is opened saying that the user is not registered and a link to the html RegistrarUsuario is shown. If the information introduced in the html
IntroducirComentari.html, a new html is displayed showing a link to show all the opinions.
When clicking on it, a list with all the opinions introduced is displayed.
