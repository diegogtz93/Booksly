The objective of the function and html "Conversaciones" is to display the conversations of the user introduced by the user in the text box. This is done by accessing a database with the information of the conversations and users that belong to each conversation. 

Example: If you introduce Diego, it should display Conversacion2


Note: There is a problem with the code, it doesn't display the conversations eventhough there are no errors.
